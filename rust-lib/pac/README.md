# MAX78000 Peripheral Access Crate
This crate provides low-level access to the MAX78000 microcontroller's peripherals. It is generated from the SVD file provided in the MSDK (which was slightly modified to generate the PAC correctly).

The following commands were used to generate the crate (assuming `svd2rust` and `form` are installed).

```
svd2rust -i max78000.svd -o .
form -i lib.rs -o src/
rm lib.rs
cargo fmt --all
```

Modifications should not be made to the generated code, but rather to the SVD file. If the SVD file is updated, the crate can be regenerated by running the commands above. Higher-level functions should be implemented as a separate HAL crate.
